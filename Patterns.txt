Recursion & Backtracking Patterns
----------------------------------
1. Permutation
   Description:
     - You're arranging all elements in all possible orders
   Common Problems:
     - Permutations of an array or string (e.g., [1,2,3])
     - Letter Tile Possibilities
     - Next Permutation

2. Combination
   Description:
     - You're picking some elements in some order (usually order doesn't matter)
   Common Problems:
     - Combination Sum (I, II)
     - Combinations (pick k from n)
     - Phone Number Letter Combinations

3. Subset
   Description:
     - You're deciding for each element: include or exclude
   Common Problems:
     - Subsets (Power Set)
     - Subsets with Duplicates
     - Partition Equal Subset Sum

4. Path/Grid
   Description:
     - You're moving from a starting point to an end point (e.g., grid, maze)
   Common Problems:
     - Unique Paths (with or without obstacles)
     - Rat in a Maze
     - Word Search
     - Flood Fill / Island Count

5. Constraint-Based
   Description:
     - You can only pick/add something if it meets specific rules or limits
   Common Problems:
     - Valid Parentheses (only add ')' if open > close)
     - Restore IP Addresses (each part must be â‰¤255, no leading zero)
     - N-Queens Problem (no attacking queens)
     - Sudoku Solver (row/col/box constraints)
